# nginx-apache-tomcat-loadbalancer
This project demonstrates a real-world scenario where NGINX is configured as a reverse proxy and load balancer to distribute HTTP requests between Apache (serving static HTML) and Tomcat (serving dynamic Java WAR content). It ensures high availability and balanced traffic distribution in a microservices-based architecture.
